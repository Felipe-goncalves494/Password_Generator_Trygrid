## About the Project and Prototype

The goal of this prototype is to serve as a strong password generator. After detailed research during development, it became clear that users of computer systems and internet networks often create predictable passwords. These passwords can be easily guessed through brute-force attacks or malicious tools.

Please note: This is only a **prototype** of the official product, which is currently in its final development and refinement phase.

## We appreciate any suggestions and feedback for future improvements.
